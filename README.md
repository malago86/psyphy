# PsyPhy

PsyPhy is a Javascript-based tool that aims to make the design of experiments as simple as possible. This tool loads an experiment file with the configuration and location of the stimuli and runs the experiment in the same platform. Participant’s data is stored in a secure website and locked behind a password. The experimenter can download the data to analyze it. The PsyPhy tool is optimized for medical image perception experiments but it is also useful for other simple perception experiments such as MAFC and visual search.

## Getting Started

The experimenter can distribute the .pso file containing the setup of the experiment. Participants must load that experiment file or access the corresponding URL. If specified, an link to the instructions will show. After clicking on the Start button the calibration screen will show and the experiment will begin. Browser’s full screen mode will activate and the participant will have to finish all the trials in one session. Trials will be presented in a condition and trial randomized order for each participant. If a feedback stimulus is present, it will be shown after the participant responds.
